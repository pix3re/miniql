# Mini-Database – MiniQL

An educational project built purely out of curiosity and for practicing low-level programming skills.

The goal of MiniQL is to implement a lightweight relational database with a minimal feature set, inspired by SQLite.

### Current Status

At this stage, the database supports only a very limited set of commands as the project is still in early development.

### Planned Commands

.exit – quit the database

CREATE / ALTER / DROP <table>

SELECT / INSERT / UPDATE / DELETE FROM <table>

### Roadmap

The initial focus is on building a functional REPL and basic query parsing. Over time, more commands, usage examples, and documentation will be added.
